# AquaCare

"AquaCare" by Purgyil Technologies represents my innovative work in water management. Utilizing IoT, I tracked water parameters (volume, turbidity, temperature), triggering alarms for limit breaches. With skills in Thingsboard and Flutter, I integrated a robust backend and seamless frontend. Empowering users to manage water efficiently, promoting sustainability, and environmental consciousness in Himachal Pradesh.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track water parameters such as volume, turbidity, and temperature.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Receive alarms when parameters exceed predefined limits.
- **Data Visualization**: Intuitive tools for visualizing and analyzing data to make informed decisions.
- **Device Management**: Monitor individual or grouped IoT devices efficiently.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Seamless and intuitive user experience using Flutter.
